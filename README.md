**This website** is designed to direct a consumer of Comic Books and Comic Book Movies to the proper sequence for watching Comic Books movies, and where to find more information on the characters. This website is designed to address both *Marvel* and *DC* movies, as well as some other publishers like *Image* and *Dark Horse*.



**Here are images of my project, there is code, the website itself, and misc. items.**
